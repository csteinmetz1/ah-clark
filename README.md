As part of the final senior design course in ECE at Clemson, we were tasked with building an air hockey robot to play autonomously. This included designing and building the mechanical, electrical, and software subsystems required. 

## Overview

* [Hardware schematic](docs/motor_control_schematic.pdf) 	- Full definition of the electrical subsystem
* [Simulink model](motor_control/simulink/PID_Interactive_3.slx)	 - Model to be run on the Tiva microcontroller
* [Basic arm control](motor_control/basic_xy)	- Simple program to control the position of the arm for testing
* [Main gameplay code](clark/PSEyeDemo)	- Main program which includes gameplay logic and user interface
